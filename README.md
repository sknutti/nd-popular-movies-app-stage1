This app is part one of a project for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.  The app is a
basic movie lookup app, using some of the basic functionality of Android like AsyncTasks and
Adapters.  There is a second project to build on this app and extend it with additional
functionality.

In order to run this app successfully, you need to put your TMDB api key
in MainActivityFragment.java on line 122.
